# Gameplay Terrain Editor

#What it can do

1) it will randomly generate terrains based on a seed

2) it will create trees on the terrains

3) it will page the terrains in a vector, render terrains and trees based on distance

4) it can save the terrains in a binary file

5) it can edit the terrains vertices

#What is wrong with it

1) it possibly have a bad syntax

2) there's some bugs with the editor tools and files managing tools

3) it wasn't tested on mac and linux platforms

4) most of the tools are either partially working or and doesn't have a UI to be conditionally useful

5) 75% of all the project contains functions that aren't commented(lol)

#What i will try to change

1) there's a TODO somewhere(may include stomach ache and nausea)

#What will i not change

1) i don't feel like testing this project on a linux or mac platform
