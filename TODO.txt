=====================UPCOMING_FEATURES

-------------------------LATTER

i noticed that most generators functions create a world space positioning then convert it back to heightfield local space(returnHeight()) to query heigtfield height which is very inneficient and pretty dumb
it can probably query heightfield height without a world space positioning since i only send heightfield(and not terrains) to the generators functions

add blendmap settings in the UI form that generate terrains

when in editing mode mouse wheel should be able to increase or decrease selection ring size

saving normalmaps,blendmaps, terrains, objects positions , materials and scenes per tile in a compressed file using fastLZ or someshit https://github.com/ariya/FastLZ/blob/master/fastlz.c

add support for nav mesh generation https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation

Angular terrain editing tools

fix the "smooth" editing tool

Generate terrains,normalmaps,blendmaps and object positions on a GPU(if possible)

stick bunch of heightfields together in low detail as an overview feature to save GPU power + button

implement vertical paging

optimize long distance traveling by virtually moving terrains and objects around as a virtual camera
optimize the virtual camera by preventing buffer overflow on the position value
	
if i had maximum height from when creating terrains then i wouldn't need to generate all blendmaps all at once before starting the lazy thread that's encoding blendmaps into PNGs...that would be an optimization
=============================

==========================BUGS

the painting tool seem slow when used against terrains with specific positions(for E.A : the terrain at 0,0,0 would be painted normally but the others would be painted slower)

the aligning function is missing 4 vertexes alignment between 4 terrains extremities
the diamondSquare noiser look too much smooth on Y scale
theres no checks against segmentation fault for terrains with certain patchsize versus heightfield size
=============================
