-------------------------MAJOR

add object material name inside the filenames. for e.g : field-0-0.bin.terrain.material , 0-0-objects.gbp.object.material, 0-0-objects.gbp.objects.scene

Toggling between last editing tool and Nagivate by pressing TAB
Angular terrain editing tools
Generate Tiles and Blendmap on a GPU? lol
stick bunch of heightfields together in low detail as an overview feature to save GPU power + button
implement vertical paging
optimize long distance traveling by virtually moving terrains around as a virtual camera
optimize the virtual camera by preventing buffer overflow on the position value
have gameplay highlight the button or something when you click on it
make editing tools less clicky and more volatile
Texture Painting tool

if i had maximum height from when creating terrains then i wouldn't need to generate all blendmaps all at once before starting the lazy thread that's encoding blendmaps into PNGs...that would be an optimization

-----------------------------

=============================

==========================BUG

1)Editing functions should have more than 4 conditional boundaries... more like 8 to support the selection of extremitys between 4 terrains
2)the aligning function is missing 4 vertexes aligniment between 4 terrains extremity
3)the diamond simplex noiser look too much smooth on Y scale
6)theres no checks against segmentation fault for terrains with certain patchsize versus heightfield size
